/// or by a `Contract`.

/// The first function, `test_store()`, will test the values that are being
/// stored by our contract. This is accomplished by generating a couple user
/// accounts, storing data as those users, and ensuring retrieved data matches
/// what we would expect it to be. We are also checking against a keypair that
/// hasn't stored any data, ensuring we receive Bytes of length 0 in return.
